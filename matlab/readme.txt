This archive contains the NCCA model,

I've been trying to keep it consistent with the rest of the toolboxes
but I had to make two changes. As this model needs more than one argument
to give output I added varargin to modelOut.

I haven't been able to get it to work fully with modelOptimise as for some
reason it doesn't like to be called multiple times.
